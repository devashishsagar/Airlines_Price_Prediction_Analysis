# Airlines_Price_Prediction_Analysis
The project idea is to showcase the variation in the flight prices based on different factors like departure/arrival time, destinations, business/economy class etc.
This project is an excellent approach for a marketing manager to compare the prices.

It will answer the below questions:

a) Does price vary with Airlines?

b) How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?

c) Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?

d) How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?

e) How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
